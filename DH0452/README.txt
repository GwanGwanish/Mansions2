If you are using an iOS mobile device, like an iPad, congratulations, you purchased a product from a company that has a condescending view of its customers. As a result, you are not allowed to freely install programs on your device. Sadly, there is no native app for mobile iOS or Mac OS like the for Android or Windows. Instead, you will need to install an app that permits it to stream the operation of another personal device you own. For example, you could install the “DH0452” app onto your Windows desktop, and then use the free “Moonlight” iOS app on the App Store to stream “DH0452” from your desktop to your iPad. There are several free streaming apps like “Moonlight” that you can find online. Sorry!

Belated Merry Christmas! Enjoy!
